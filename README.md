## PC Repair & Mods

This git is for my personal business website, Aurora Tech Repair. I will be adding multiple versions to remind myself of everything I learned during my time at NAIT, mostly how to code websites properly.

The versions I will be making depend on the complexity of the website:
- HTML/CSS website to create a starting basis
- React/JS-based website using Material UI where I can add more features and make it prettier than before

I may also add in APIs and databases in the future to aid in making the website easier for customers to use and check the status of their repairs:
- Google Calendar API (to show my availability)
- Firebase or mySQL database (running on my server PC, logins and repair status)

There may also be a mobile app I create so that I can check everything on-the-go, which would be done using flutter and dart (possibly another using Rust, would have to learn from scratch. Never learned at NAIT)

My reasoning for making this website (and business) is simple. While I was working at Walmart in the Electronics section, I realized that they didn't want personal connections or to actually help people with deciding on a purchase before letting them buy it- they wanted them in and out the door as quick as possible; where people should already have their minds made up before they buy anything. That is not a good business structure for electronics in my mind, and won't thrive as much as they think it will. For me, taking time to understand the person's needs and wants is very important and helps the customer feel more relaxed while purchasing. That way you will have a good connection and a customer for life. If you treat them with the respect and the time they deserve, they will be coming to you instead. Most people don't care how fast or slow you are, it's about being kind to others that makes the deal happen. At Walmart, I told people to take as much time as they need to decide. I didn't care about being disliked by the co-workers or management, it was the proper thing to do.
